        "\n",
        "In academia and research, the focus of ML is usually to build the best possible models for a given dataset. However, in practical applications, the overall performance of our application is often determined primarily by data quality, not by the model. That is why many ML practitioners advocate for **Data-Centric** ML approaches, where we focus on improving the data while keeping the ML model (mostly) fixed. See [this great article](https://neptune.ai/blog/data-centric-vs-model-centric-machine-learning) by neptune.ai for more details on model-centric vs. data-centric ML.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most critical parts of data-centric ML is to monitor data quality. Throughout this chapter, we will learn about many potential data issues, such as train-test skew, training-serving skew, data drift, and more. Being aware of these issues, and having respective safety mechanisms in place, is essential when serving ML models to real users.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we will start by automatically checking for **Data Skew** within our ML pipelines. Since the performance of ML models on unseen data can be unpredictable, we should always try to design our training data to match the actual environment where our model will later be deployed. The difference between those data distributions is called **Training-Serving Skew**. Similarly, differences in distribution between our training and testing datasets are called **Train-Test Skew**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following, we will use the open-source data monitoring tool [Evidently](https://evidentlyai.com/) to measure distribution differences between our datasets. See this little [blog post](https://blog.zenml.io/zenml-loves-evidently/) of ours that explains the Evidently integration in more detail."
